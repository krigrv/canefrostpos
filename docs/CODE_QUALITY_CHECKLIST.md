# Code Quality Checklist

## Overview

This document provides a checklist for maintaining high code quality in the CaneFrost POS application. Following these guidelines will help ensure the codebase remains maintainable, reliable, and easy to extend.

## Function Design

### ✅ Consistent API Design

- [ ] Functions with similar purposes follow consistent naming patterns
- [ ] Getter functions are prefixed with `get` (e.g., `getCartTotal`, `getPackagingCharge`)
- [ ] Boolean state variables use `is`, `has`, or `should` prefixes (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- [ ] Event handlers use `handle` prefix (e.g., `handleSubmit`, `handleChange`)
- [ ] Functions that perform actions use verb-noun format (e.g., `addSale`, `deleteSale`)

### ✅ Documentation

- [ ] All functions have JSDoc comments explaining their purpose
- [ ] Parameters are documented with types and descriptions
- [ ] Return values are documented with types and descriptions
- [ ] Complex logic includes inline comments explaining the reasoning
- [ ] Edge cases and special behaviors are documented

### ✅ Input Validation

- [ ] Functions validate all required parameters
- [ ] Type checking is performed where TypeScript is not available
- [ ] Range/boundary validation is performed for numeric inputs
- [ ] Empty/null checks are performed for required objects and arrays
- [ ] Date validations ensure proper date formats and ranges

## Error Handling

### ✅ Comprehensive Error Handling

- [ ] All async functions use try/catch blocks
- [ ] Error messages are descriptive and actionable
- [ ] Errors are properly logged for debugging
- [ ] User-facing error messages are friendly and helpful
- [ ] Critical operations have specific error handling for different failure modes

### ✅ Fallback Mechanisms

- [ ] Functions return sensible defaults when errors occur
- [ ] Alternative data sources are used when primary sources fail
- [ ] UI gracefully degrades when data is unavailable
- [ ] Calculation functions include fallbacks to prevent NaN/undefined (e.g., `|| 0`)

## Performance Optimization

### ✅ React Optimization

- [ ] Heavy calculations are memoized with `useMemo`
- [ ] Callback functions are memoized with `useCallback`
- [ ] Components are memoized with `React.memo` when appropriate
- [ ] Dependencies arrays for hooks are properly specified
- [ ] Large lists use virtualization techniques

### ✅ Data Fetching

- [ ] Data fetching includes loading states
- [ ] Pagination is implemented for large data sets
- [ ] Caching strategies are implemented where appropriate
- [ ] Unnecessary re-fetches are prevented

## Testing

### ✅ Unit Tests

- [ ] Core business logic has unit tests
- [ ] Edge cases are covered in tests
- [ ] Error handling is tested
- [ ] Mocks are used for external dependencies

### ✅ Integration Tests

- [ ] Component interactions are tested
- [ ] Database operations are tested with test databases
- [ ] API integrations have integration tests

## Code Organization

### ✅ Component Structure

- [ ] Components follow single responsibility principle
- [ ] Business logic is separated from presentation
- [ ] Context providers are used for shared state
- [ ] Custom hooks extract reusable logic

### ✅ File Organization

- [ ] Related files are grouped in directories
- [ ] Consistent file naming conventions are followed
- [ ] Index files export public API for directories
- [ ] Common utilities are centralized

## Security

### ✅ Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive data is not logged or exposed
- [ ] User inputs are validated and sanitized
- [ ] Authentication checks are performed for protected operations
- [ ] Database queries are parameterized to prevent injection

## Accessibility

### ✅ UI Accessibility

- [ ] Semantic HTML elements are used appropriately
- [ ] ARIA attributes are added where necessary
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG standards
- [ ] Keyboard navigation is supported
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility is maintained

## Documentation

### ✅ Code Documentation

- [ ] Complex components have README files
- [ ] API documentation is maintained
- [ ] Architecture decisions are documented
- [ ] Setup and deployment instructions are documented

## Review Process

Use this checklist during code reviews to ensure all quality standards are met:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as expected?
2. **Readability**: Is the code easy to understand?
3. **Maintainability**: Will the code be easy to modify in the future?
4. **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
5. **Security**: Are there any security vulnerabilities?
6. **Testing**: Is the code adequately tested?
7. **Documentation**: Is the code properly documented?

## Example: Before and After Code Quality Improvements

### Before

```javascript
function calc() {
  let t = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < cart.length; i++) {
    t += cart[i].price * cart[i].quantity;
  }
  return t + (t * 0.18);
}

function handleClick() {
  if (cart.length > 0) {
    const sale = {
      items: cart,
      total: calc(),
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
    
    addSale(sale).then(() => {
      setCart([]);
    });
  }
}
```

### After

```javascript
/**
 * Calculates the cart subtotal (before tax)
 * @returns {number} The sum of (price × quantity) for all items
 */
const getCartSubtotal = () => {
  return cart.reduce((total, item) => total + (item.price * item.quantity), 0) || 0;
};

/**
 * Calculates the tax amount for the current cart
 * @returns {number} The tax amount based on the configured tax rate
 */
const getCartTax = () => {
  return getCartSubtotal() * TAX_RATE || 0;
};

/**
 * Calculates the total amount including tax
 * @returns {number} The total cart amount including tax
 */
const getCartTotal = () => {
  return getCartSubtotal() + getCartTax() || 0;
};

/**
 * Processes a new order and saves the sale
 */
const handlePlaceOrder = async () => {
  try {
    // Validate cart is not empty
    if (cart.length === 0) {
      toast.error("Cannot place order with empty cart");
      return;
    }
    
    // Prevent multiple submissions
    if (processingPayment) {
      return;
    }
    
    setProcessingPayment(true);
    
    const sale = {
      items: cart,
      subtotal: getCartSubtotal(),
      tax: getCartTax(),
      total: getCartTotal(),
      timestamp: new Date(),
      transactionId: generateOrderId()
    };
    
    const saleId = await addSale(sale);
    
    if (saleId) {
      toast.success("Order placed successfully!");
      setCart([]);
      // Reset other state...
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error placing order:", error);
    toast.error("Failed to place order: " + error.message);
  } finally {
    setProcessingPayment(false);
  }
};
```
